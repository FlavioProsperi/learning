Pcrossover_preservation = 0.98
Pmutate = 0.2

Create population of random values.
Loop until children make up same sized population
  Choose two parents (Higher fitness = higher chance of being chosen)
  Create two children
    If rand > Pcrossover_preservation, then no crossover; children same as parents
    Else choose a crossover point and swap sides so x1x2,y1y2 becomes x1y2,y1x2
    Optionally mutate a single gene if rand < Pmutate
Stop looping when child has acceptable fitness
