# PAR: Practical Awesome Recursion



This series will focus on usage and applicability.
It will be scarce in theory, and abundant in examples.
The theory is valuable and fascinating, but I often find that knowing the
theory alone is only half understanding. Full understanding both comes from, and enables,
practical application. I recommend you bounce back and forth between this series and theory.
The internet is rich with blogs and videos on theory that explain it better than I would, so use those awesome resources.




What's the point?
=================
* Intuitions above morphisms
* How they work
* Examples: simple (list,trees,dsl,nat,json)
* Examples: real-world (like Coins)


What's out of scope?
====================
* Impl details of morphisms



.lib
- fns and definitions? Or just use microlibs

.data
- common structures for examples (eg. List,Nat,BinTree,VectorTree)

.ch01
- code from posts




ana - F -> ? \/ A
