What's the point?
=================
* Intuitions above morphisms
* How they work
* Examples: simple (list,trees,dsl,nat,json)
* Examples: real-world (like Coins)


What's out of scope?
====================
* Impl details of morphisms



.lib
- fns and definitions? Or just use microlibs

.data
- common structures for examples (eg. List,Nat,BinTree,VectorTree)

.ch01
