# Practical Awesome Recursion

This is a series of blog posts about recursion schemes.
This series uses Scala, and will focus on usage and applicability.
It will be scarce in theory, and abundant in examples.
The theory is valuable and fascinating, but I often find that knowing the theory alone is only half understanding.
The other half of understanding comes from, and enables, practical application.
I recommend you bounce back and forth between this series and theory.
The internet is rich with blogs and videos on theory that explain it better than I would, so use those awesome resources.
