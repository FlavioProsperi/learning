Use Json generator as an example
Add my info like twitter,shipreq to end and/or beginning
  - twitter, github
  - brief history of exp - yrs programming, yrs in scala, yrs with FP
  - shipreq: purpose & tech
Mention like changing stuff
  - FP
  - Prop testing
  - Scala JS
  - Curry-Howard
  - Algebras
Hidden behind intimidating jargon. Actually simple.
Agenda - emphasise that how it works needn't be understood
Mention pond-recursion as an alternative - maybe have a libraries page, 1 slide per lib: me & Matroyshka.
Live code at a few points:
  - algebra
  - JsonF (maybe)
  - CoalgebraM[Gen, JsonF, Int]
  - samples & paste into jsonlint.com
Emphasise & further describe map fusion & hylo
Nyaya: Mention that there are a few modules. gen is standalone.
